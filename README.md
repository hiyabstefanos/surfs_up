# Surf's Up

Analyzing weather trends using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we analysed weather trends - specifically for the months of June and December - to determine if it would be sustainable to run a surf shop year round in Oahu. This was accomplished by accessing the meteorlogical data for Hawaii, querying the data, and looking at summary statistics in a data frame.
